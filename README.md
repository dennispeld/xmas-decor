# xmas-decor

### User story
As a geeky christmas fan I want to generate ASCII shapes of stars and trees in three different
sizes so that I can decorate my office nicely for christmas.

### Details
The designer has provided the following designs for the shapes:

The following sizes should be available:
* **S** [mall]: 5 lines height
* **M** [edium]: 7 lines height
* **L** [arge]: 11 lines height

If the user does not provide a size, pick a random size.  
It should be possible to output the shapes both on the command line and in a browser.

### Hints
* Consider that adding new shapes should be possible in the future.
* You donâ€™t have to make the output depend on actual user input. For the sake of this task
having an easy way of faking user input in the code is enough.
* Bonus: Add unit tests

### Setup
- make sure you use the latest version of PHP (7.4)
- composer install
- symfony serve

### Testing the console part
- open your terminal app
- cd to the root of the project
- type the following command:  
`php bin/console xmas tree --size=L`  
You can use either 'tree' or 'star', the size could me S, M or L. 
The --size parameter is optional, if it is not specified, it will be selected randomly.
- try to write a shape, that doesn't exist, for example  
`php bin/console xmas bell`
- try to write a size, that doesn't exist
`php bin/console xmas tree --size=XXL`

### Testing the browser part
- open your browser and go to
`http://127.0.0.1:8000/xmas/tree/L`  
You can use either 'tree' or 'star', the size could me S, M or L.  
The last parameter (size) is optional, if it is not specified, it will be selected randomly.
- try to write a shape, that doesn't exist, for example  
`http://127.0.0.1:8000/xmas/bell`
- try to write a size, that doesn't exist
`http://127.0.0.1:8000/xmas/tree/XXL`
